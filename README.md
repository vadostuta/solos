# Solos Cashflow Intelligence

Solos normalizes payout streams from Shopify and Amazon into a single ledger so merchants see a real-time “big picture” of expected and received cash. A unified dashboard surfaces KPI cards, interactive charts, and transaction drill-downs, while an InsightEngine prompt turns cleaned data into six+ high-signal AI cards across anomalies, platform performance, fees/refunds, timing, and momentum. The result is consistent payouts forecasting, faster variance reviews, and action-ready guidance anchored to the same normalized dataset.
